# snake-game

The beloved Nokia 3310 game. Its beginnings go further back to the year of 1976, where game publisher Gremlin, designed and developed it for the arcade game Blockade. The game was further cloned by many large game developers at that time. It had its most success with the old Nokia monochrome phones.

## How does the game work

The game is played with the up, down, right and left keyboard keys. The snakes position is randomly set with each start of the game. The goal is to make the snake as long as posible, this is done by consuming squares that are displayed randomly on the play-field. These squares will be refered as "food" in the botom sections. The game end if the snake touches the edges of the playfield or touches its own body.  

## Project Description

Remembering the game has made me feel nostalgic and I wanted to recreate it. I though that this would also display my Vanilla JavaScript skills and creativity in expanding on the game features that we did see before. This game was developed in several phases depending on my coding skills. 

### Technologies used and why

The game was developed using only JavaScript, CSS and HTML, it is uncertain if in the future further libraries or programming languages will be implemented.

### Challenges faced and features for the future




#### Features

 - Add the simple feature where the game counts the length of the snakes body at the end of each game and saves top5 results in local storage. 

 - Add "food" that are two and tree squares long and positioned either vertically or horizontally. Snake has to eat the food at a certain angle or its game over. These could come randomly once in a while as a "mini-boss". 

 - Make different version of the game, one could be where the tail end of the "snake" could be in fixed position and the "food" would shorten the snakes body by a certain ammount.
