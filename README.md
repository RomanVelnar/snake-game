The beloved Nokia 3310 game. Its beginnings go further back to the year of 1976, where game publisher Gremlin, designed and developed it for the arcade game Blockade. The game was further cloned by many large game developers at that time. It had its most success with the old Nokia monochrome phones.

## How does the game work

The game is played with the up, down, right and left keyboard keys. The snakes position is randomly set with each start of the game. The goal is to make the snake as long as posible, this is done by consuming squares that are displayed randomly on the play-field.
